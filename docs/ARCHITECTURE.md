# Architecture and proposal coverage

The prototype follows the seven-step workflow in the supplied COSC-5926 proposal.

| Proposal step | Implementation | Review evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upload/preprocessing | `media.normalize_audio` converts to 16 kHz mono PCM; bounded file size/duration | FFmpeg integration tests |
| Speech transcription | `pipeline.process` loads WhisperX and transcribes in batches | Adapter contract test; real-model smoke test pending |
| Speaker diarization | WhisperX `DiarizationPipeline` wraps pyannote community-1 | Adapter test; real-model quality pending |
| Word/speaker alignment | Forced alignment followed by `assign_word_speakers`; cues split by word speaker | Core speaker-turn and untimed-word tests |
| Optional emotion | English DistilRoBERTa classifier; separate cue metadata; confidence threshold | Optional branch adapter test; quality pending |
| Synchronized display | Streamlit and an embedded HTML player using the same media clock for cues and words | UI flow test; interactive browser verification pending |
| Subtitle export | Speaker-prefixed SRT, styled VTT, and JSON for reopening | Serialization, escaping, and CLI export tests |

## Data flow

1. The browser sends an uploaded recording to the local Streamlit process.
2. A temporary file is passed to FFmpeg; only its normalized waveform enters the ML pipeline.
3. WhisperX produces transcript segments and the detected language.
4. Forced alignment produces word times and optional alignment confidence scores.
5. pyannote clusters speaker turns; WhisperX assigns speakers by temporal overlap.
6. The cue builder groups contiguous words, splitting at speaker changes and length targets.
7. The optional emotion model adds labels to separate fields; it never rewrites transcript text.
8. The project is stored in session memory. Edits are applied to a deep copy and validated atomically.
9. Exports serialize reviewed cues. JSON additionally retains original words and original caption text.

## Deliberate decisions

**UNKNOWN labels:** no nearest-speaker filling is enabled. When evidence is absent, the interface
shows UNKNOWN rather than presenting a guessed identity as established.

**Original alignment:** edits do not attempt to estimate new word timestamps. Word highlighting is
disabled after text/time edits; the old alignment remains an inspectable record.

**Emotion:** a text classifier is an approximation of sentiment expressed in words. It cannot reliably
infer sarcasm, intonation, or feelings. It is English-only and optional; its failure does not discard captions.

**Resource use:** ASR and alignment models are released before the next heavy stage. CPU defaults to int8,
CUDA to float16. Models are loaded per run rather than globally cached with a user's access token.

**Playback:** a single HTML media element drives all active cues, including simultaneous cues. Labels
accompany colors, keyboard-accessible seek buttons jump to cue starts, and gaps clear captions.
All transcript and speaker strings are inserted using DOM `textContent`; embedded JSON escapes HTML
script delimiters. VTT text also escapes markup.

## Deferred production work

Background jobs/cancellation; model dependency locks for each supported platform; streaming and long-file
chunking; durable project database; authentication; real speech benchmark evaluation; accessible usability
study; overlapping-speaker presentation research; timestamp re-alignment after edits; and scalable media
serving instead of base64 embedding. None is claimed as implemented.
