# Context Caption

**Context-aware captioning for multi-speaker media**

COSC-5926 — Advanced Human-Computer Interaction

A local Streamlit prototype that combines WhisperX transcription and forced word alignment,
pyannote speaker diarization, and optional transcript-based emotion cues in an editable caption workflow.

## What you can do

- Upload audio/video; convert it to 16 kHz mono audio using FFmpeg.
- Transcribe speech and inspect original word timestamps and alignment scores.
- Split captions on word-level speaker changes, with consistent speaker labels and colors.
- Play media with synchronized captions, highlighted words, and click-to-seek controls.
- Rename speakers, edit text/timing/speaker assignments, and search the transcript.
- Optionally estimate English text emotion without modifying spoken content.
- Export speaker-aware SRT, styled VTT, or a JSON project retaining original words and edits.
- Reopen a JSON project and reattach its original media.
- Try a predefined two-voice synthetic demo without downloading ML models or providing a token.

## Start with the demo

Use Python 3.12 for the simplest match to local validation. The package accepts Python 3.10–3.13;
other versions are configured in CI but have not been tested in the authoring environment.

```bash
cd context-caption
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

On Windows, create the environment with `py -3.12 -m venv .venv` and activate it with
`.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in PowerShell instead of the `source` command.

Open `http://localhost:8501` and select **Load sample project**. The supplied WAV contains
synthetic voices from FFmpeg's Flite filter. Its captions and word times are predefined for UI testing:
**they are not results of ASR or diarization**. Regeneration is optional; see `examples/create_demo.py`.

## Enable actual transcription and diarization

1. Install FFmpeg and confirm `ffmpeg -version` works.
   - macOS with Homebrew: `brew install ffmpeg`
   - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
   - Windows: use an FFmpeg build linked from <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html> and add its `bin` to PATH.
2. In your active virtual environment, run:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -e '.[ml]'
   ```

   This installs WhisperX 3.8.6, including its compatible PyTorch/pyannote dependencies, and Transformers.
   The demo UI and core tests do not require this extra. A resolved cross-platform ML lockfile is not
   included; native wheels depend on operating system and GPU. Keep this environment separate from
   existing MLX/LoRA installations.
3. Sign into Hugging Face and accept the access conditions at
   <https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1>.
4. Create a read token with permission to access that model. Enter it in the sidebar or set `HF_TOKEN`
   in your shell. Do not paste tokens into GitHub, captions, notebooks, or the README.
5. Start the app. Upload a short, clear recording with two consenting speakers, confirm permission,
   select **CPU / base / batch size 4**, and click **Generate captions**.
6. Review names, text, and times before exporting. Model downloads require internet on first use.

macOS, including Apple Silicon, uses the **CPU** backend here. This project does not use MLX or MPS.
For NVIDIA GPUs, install a PyTorch/CUDA runtime supported by your WhisperX installation before selecting
CUDA. Use the official [WhisperX setup guide](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX#setup-) for platform details.
Start with `tiny` and batch size `1` if memory is limited. Allow 10–20 GB for dependencies and model caches.

## Command line

After installing the ML extra and setting `HF_TOKEN`:

```bash
context-caption --input recording.mp4 --device cpu --model base --min-speakers 2 --max-speakers 2 --output outputs
```

Add `--emotions` for English text emotion estimates, or `--language en` to fix the language.
The token is read from the environment rather than a CLI argument.

Re-export the supplied JSON without ML models:

```bash
context-caption --project examples/demo_project.json --output outputs/demo
```

This produces `captions.srt`, `captions.vtt`, and `captions.json`. Outputs are ignored by Git.

## Checks

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
python -m ruff check .
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Tests exercise caption behavior, import/export, security escaping, media conversion, the adapter with
stubbed ML modules, and the Streamlit editing flow. **Stubbed ML tests do not validate model quality**.
The optional real-model smoke test in [docs/EVALUATION.md](docs/EVALUATION.md) needs your model access.
CI installs the base/dev package, not GPU dependencies or gated models.

## Important behavior and limits

- Diarization labels cluster voices within one recording. They do not establish real-world identities
  or link people across recordings. Manual speaker names are review annotations.
- Overlapping speech, accents, noise, short utterances, and rapid turns can reduce quality.
- A word without alignment remains explicitly untimed (`null`). It is not silently dropped or assigned
  a fabricated timestamp. Untimed groups use the original segment bounds for display and need review.
- Cue length targets are 84 characters and six seconds. A single long token or fallback segment can
  exceed those targets; this is a prototype, not a broadcast subtitle compliance validator.
- Editing text or cue times disables word highlighting for that cue; original word timings remain
  available in JSON and the Word timestamps tab. Text edits clear stale emotion predictions.
- Emotion is inferred from English text, not vocal prosody or a person's internal state. Only predictions
  at confidence >= 0.60 are shown; low confidence stays unlabeled. Emotion is hidden by default.
- SRT uses plain speaker names. VTT adds color classes; external players differ in styling support.
- Upload limit: 200 MiB; processing limit: 60 minutes. FFmpeg conversion times out after five minutes.
  Model inference is synchronous and may take much longer on CPU. There is no background queue/cancel.
- Playback embeds media in the local app and uses extra memory. Prefer short clips for class demos.
  Caption edits or other reruns reset playback position.
- Uploaded/converted files use temporary directories and are removed after processing. Media bytes and
  captions remain in the current session until cleared; save project JSON and media separately to resume.
  Model caches persist locally. No analytics or application-level external media API is included;
  third-party model libraries have their own download/telemetry behavior.
- No authentication or multi-user isolation is provided. Bind to localhost; this prototype is not ready
  to expose to the public internet.
